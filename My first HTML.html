    <p> You can always count on me when </p>
    <p> A funny story </p>
    <p> I live in RGP in which I have to do quests every day and get rewards.<br>
        It is what my friends say about me because I always be in randon events. <br>
        Examples of it happened twice in last 6 months. In the first event I went <br>
        to the toilet in the Central Station, and I got a bottle of wine in the toilet. <br>
        The seconde time was two days ago, when I was going to my Dutch  <br>
        class and I found a nice book about gardnes plants and their cientific  <br>
        identification. In resume, my live is an adventure
