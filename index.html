    <p> A funny story </p>
    <p> My life looks like a RGP game in which I have to do quests every day and get rewards.<br>
        This is what my friends say about me because random events happen to me. <br>
        Examples of it happened twice in last 6 months. In the first event I went <br>
        to the toilet in the Central Station and someone gave me a bottle of wine  <br>
        in the toilet. The seconde time was two days ago, when I was going to my   <br>
        Dutch class and I found a nice book on the street about gardnes plants and   <br>
        their cientific identification (I am a biologist). In short, my live is an adventure!
